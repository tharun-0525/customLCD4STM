📘 Project Title:
Custom LCD Driver Development for STM32 Microcontroller (HD44780 16x2 in 4-bit mode)

📝 Project Description:

This project involves the step-by-step development of a custom driver to interface an HD44780-compatible 16x2 LCD with an STM32 microcontroller using 4-bit mode. The goal is to build a lightweight, modular, and reusable driver from scratch without relying on external libraries like HAL’s LCD utilities.

The project is designed to enhance low-level understanding of microcontroller peripheral control, bitwise operations, GPIO configuration, and LCD communication protocols.

The driver will support core functionalities such as:

Sending data/commands in 4-bit mode
Cursor and display shifting
Entry mode configuration
Clear display, return home, and display control
